List of Bugs:

1 . Methods removeFront() and removeBack() both simply return "false" and neither of them actually remove the nodes. Note: This causes some of the size() method's tests to fail, as m_size is not decremented as expected. 

2. Method addBack() actually adds to the front of the list.

Memory leaks:
Because the both the removeFront() and removeBack() methods do not do their job, and because the destructor likely relies on them, this program has unavoidable memory leaks.
